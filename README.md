I'm trying learn as much python as possible and document it (note: this is purely for educational purposes and you should do your own research; I'm still learning so even though most of it should be okay I might not understand everything or may make some mistakes; though over time this repo should improve)
# Retrieve
```python
# in jupyter notebook
!git clone https://github.com/Benj1bear/Advanced-python
```
